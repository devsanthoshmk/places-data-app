## App Overview

**GlobexData** lets users search for businesses/places, view detailed results with filtering and sorting, and export the data to Excel spreadsheets.

### How It Works

1. User enters a search query (e.g., "restaurants in Chennai")
2. App scrapes Google Search results using native HTTP (bypasses CORS on mobile)
3. Parses business data: name, rating, reviews, phone, address, website
4. Displays results as interactive cards with filter/sort
5. User can export all data to `.xlsx` Excel file
6. On Android: file saved to Downloads with notification + share option

### Platforms

- **Android** — Full functionality (scraping, notifications, background service, file export)
- **iOS** — Full functionality (requires macOS + Xcode for building)
- **Web Browser** — UI works, but scraping is blocked by CORS (no native HTTP bypass)
